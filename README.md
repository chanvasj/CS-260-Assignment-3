# CS-260-Assignment-3

Hello, for this assignment, we will be creating a linked queue. We will create a queue data structure using a linked list.

We will create a linked list to store our data values for our Queue class.
Our code will have three main function. The enqueue, dequeue, and peek function. 
The enqueue function will add a value to the back of the queue. 
The dequeue function will remove an element from the front of the queue and return its value 
There will be an optional peek function that will reutrn the value at the front of the queue without removing it. 

We create a main function to implement these function to create our Queue data structure!
